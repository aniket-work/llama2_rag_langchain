Let's do LLM : RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) 


Why should I read this article ?

We live in an age of rapid technological change, where innovations in artificial intelligence are transforming how we work, communicate, and access information. It's essential to stay ahead by understanding the revolutionary concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Much like discovering a secret ingredient that elevates your favorite dish, delving into RAG will open your eyes to a transformative technology that combines the best of information retrieval and content generation. This article serves as your culinary guide to RAG, explaining why it's not just a passing trend but a vital tool that will shape how we access, understand, and create information. So, if you're curious about the future of knowledge and innovation, join me as we unravel the magic of RAG and discover why it matters more than ever.

Hmm, what's the big deal ?

Imagine you're a master chef (yes, this long weekend, I watched quite a few cooking shows , which influenced my analogy)  tasked with creating a splendid meal for best friends. You have a pantry stocked with the finest ingredients, but you lack the perfect recipe to showcase your culinary skills. What if you had access to a magic cookbook that not only provided you with the most exquisite recipes but also tailored them to your unique tastes and preferences? This magical cookbook is akin to Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, and it's a technological breakthrough that we all need to care about. In this article, we'll explore RAG and explain why it's not just a buzzword but a game-changer in the world of information retrieval and content generation.

Ok, what is RAG?

Simply put, RAG combines two key abilities, 1. text generation 2. retrieving knowledge. Text generation relies on model's parametric knowledge. The knowledge retrieval part connects the language model to external databases full of relevant information. This gives the system factual knowledge and context to inform its responses, instead of just guessing or making things up.

For example, if you asked a RAG enabled system "Which planet has the most moons?" it could generate the response "For a long time Jupiter was thought to have the most moons, but recent discoveries show Saturn has overtaken it with 82 confirmed moons, compared to Jupiter's 79." This factual information comes from retrieving astronomical data, not the AI just inventing an answer.

The end result is an AI that can not only communicate naturally, but also back up what it says with actual information from reliable sources. RAG aims to produce responses augmented with real-world knowledge, not just artificial guesses.
